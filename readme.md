# Spam Detection with Naive Bayes and TF-IDF

This project implements a **spam detection system** using:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **TF-IDF vectorization**
- **Naive Bayes Classification**
- **Evaluation metrics** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC curve)

## Features & Knowledge Gained

**Text Preprocessing**:  
- Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming  
- Visualization with **WordClouds** for both Ham and Spam messages  

**Feature Extraction**:  
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for text vectorization  

**Classification Model**:  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for spam detection  

**Model Evaluation**:  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- **Confusion Matrix** visualization  
- **ROC Curve** with AUC (Area Under Curve) analysis

## Dataset

This project uses the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**:  
ðŸ”— [UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)

- **Description**: A set of SMS messages labeled as "ham" (non-spam) or "spam".
- **Size**: 5,574 SMS messages.
- **Source**: Collected for mobile phone spam detection research.
